# Early Life

<p>When I was younger I loved to play games on the computer. Me and my friends would play simple browser based games all the time. we would play on websites like Miniclip and Addicting Games.</p>

## Console
<p> As me and my friends got older we got into more console games. Most of my friends had consoles instead on PC's, so I would play multiplayer a lot on console and singleplayer on PC. We could all be playing together, but we could alo be at different locations.<p/>

### PC Gaming
<p> I first started getting into computer gaming when I bought my first gaming laptop. I saved it up from my old job at IHop, and still have it to this day (after 3-4 years).
